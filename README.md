# steel-defect-detection
Steel is one of the most important building materials of modern times.
Steel buildings are resistant to natural and man-made wear which has made the material ubiquitous around the world. 
To help make production of steel more efficient, this competition will help identify defects.
The production process of flat sheet steel is especially delicate. 

From heating and rolling, to drying and cutting, several machines touch flat steel by the time it’s ready to ship. 
Today, Severstal uses images from high frequency cameras to power a defect detection algorithm. 
In this competition, you’ll help engineers improve the algorithm by localizing and classifying surface defects on a steel sheet.
